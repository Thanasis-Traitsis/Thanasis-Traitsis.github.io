            I'm {{ calculateAge("7/7/2000") }} years old, I live in Greece and I
            like to call myself a Flutter enthusiast and Frontend Software
            Developer, with a passion for mobile development. As a graduate of
            the Department of Information Technology and Electronic Systems
            Engineering at the International University of Greece (IHU), my
            expertise blossomed, cultivating a profound understanding of
            software development principles. The first time I saw the endless
            possibilities within applications, I knew this was the path for me.
            Now, after gaining some experience in the mobile development world,
            my goal is to leverage my skills and knowledge to develop innovative
            mobile solutions.

            I am also excited about sharing my knowledge and experiences in
            Flutter development through blogging. My aim is to assist developers
            in navigating the complexities of mobile app development by offering
            tutorials, tips, and insights from my own projects and challenges.
